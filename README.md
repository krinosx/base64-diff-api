# WAES - Scalable Web Api

This is the result of the assignment given.

## Usage

### Requirements

 Application was developed using java 1.8, maven as a build tool and versioned using github.io.
 - Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)
 - Java 1.8 (https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
 - Git client (https://git-scm.com/download/)

Make sure you have the above software installed and configured in your machine. Execute the following to get the code and build the software.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/krinosx/base64-diff-api.git
$ cd base64-diff-api
$ mvn package
```
The above instructions will build an executable jar inside the <project_home>/target folder. In order to start the application run
```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
It will start an embedded Apache Tomcat server listening on 8080 port and use default profile. The default profile will use a local in memory storage.

To deploy in a production environment or to use this app as scalable web app use the mongodb profile.
```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=mongodb
```

OBS: The above procedures are not tested with Java11. Some libraries may not work and I encourage to use Java 8 for the tests. If its not possible to use Java 8, use the container version to run tests (check the end of this file to get the instructions how to run the container version).

## Endpoints Description

| Endpoint | Method | curl command | Description |
| ------ | ---- |------ |-----|
| http://{host}:{port}/v1/diff/{ID}/left | PUT | curl -i -H Accept:application/json -X PUT http://localhost:8080/v1/diff/{ID}/left -H Content-Type: application/json -d '{Base64 encoded content}' | Set the right side document to be compared for the given ID. If there is no comparision request with given ID it will create one. |
| http://{host}:{port}/v1/diff/{ID}//right | PUT | curl -i -H Accept:application/json -X PUT http://localhost:8080/v1/diff/{ID}/right -H Content-Type: application/json -d '{Base64 encoded content}' | Set the right side document to be compared for the given ID. If there is no comparision request with given ID it will create one. |
| http://{host}:{port}/v1/diff/{ID}/ | GET | curl -i -H Accept:application/json -X GET http://localhost:8080/v1/diff/{ID} | Get the comparision result for the Given ID. If there is no comparision with given ID an error will be reported |

# Documentation
In order to read the full documentation check the /docs folder on project structure. In this folder you can find:
* Architectural documents with diagrams and decisions to make the application scalable.
* Improvement suggestions


### Extra - Running as a Docker Image
If you do not have Maven or Java installed, but are used to deal with docker images, the following instructions can be used to get running ASAP.
```sh
$ docker pull giulianobortolassi/waes:base64-diff-api
$ docker run -d -e APP_PROFILE=mongodb -p {LOCAL_PORT}:8080 giulianobortolassi/waes:base64-diff-api
```
It will download and start a container with the embedded server listening on {LOCAL_PORT}. Is possible to test the API using a local REST client pointing to http://localhost:{LOCAL_PORT}/. The APP_PROFILE values must be 'mongdb' or 'default'

### Extra - AWS hosted

I hosted one instance of this application on AWS. It can be tested using the following link:

    http://ec2-54-202-207-52.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/v1/diff/{ID}
